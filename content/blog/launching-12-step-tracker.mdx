Recovery is a journey, and every step counts. That's why we've built the 12-Step Tracker - a mobile application designed to support individuals in their recovery journey through 12-step programs.

Built with React Native and Expo, the 12-Step Tracker provides a seamless, cross-platform experience for both iOS and Android users. The app features daily reflection journaling, progress tracking through all 12 steps, milestone celebrations, and gentle reminders to keep users engaged with their recovery process.

This project exemplifies our core values at Volvox. It's open source, giving back to the community. It addresses a real need with technology. And it was built collaboratively, with mentors guiding mentees through modern mobile development practices.

The app prioritizes privacy and simplicity. All data is stored locally on the user's device, and the interface is intentionally clean and distraction-free. Recovery requires focus, and our design reflects that principle.

You can try the demo at twelve-step-tracker.expo.app or contribute to the project on GitHub. We welcome community feedback and contributions as we continue to improve this tool for those who need it most.
